# World Suicide Rate Data Visualization Using D3.js


## Data 
Researches by World Health Organization show close to [800,000](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/suicide) people die due to suicide every year worldwide, and many more people attempts suicide every year. So far, suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds. 

Suicide prevention is a critical issue that may cause many social problems. Figuring out potential factors in suicide will help the health organization design strategy to prevent suicide, which will have profound impact on human happiness and social economy.

The data I propose to visualize for the World Suicide Rate Data Visualization project are originated from 
* World Health Organization
* World Bank
* United Nations Development Program
